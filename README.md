# Gradient Descent Optimization Algorithms in Neural Network
## Final Project for Gatech ECE 6254 - Statistical Machine Learing (Spring 2019)
This repository contains the codes and report for the final project of the course Statistical Machine Learing. This project focuses on both the theoretical understanding of the algorithms and their practical working scenarios in real-world applications.

The codes for networks implementation and experiments can be found in `project_code.ipynb`.
